## Introduction
I made this project just to practice learning React JS. It allows you to create, interact with, and customize mogwai.

## Developer TODO's as of 1/28/2021:
1. Create main array data of mogwai available throughout all app components with either Redux or Context API + hooks
1. Componentize main Mogwai.js file data into other JS files 
1. Have data from components correctly feed into and manipulate (or copy and manipulate) main mogwai mapped array data
1. Styles: Ensure the enabled/disabled buttons are distinct from one another on the selected mogwai top button panel
1. Only allow one mogwai selection at a time by: OnClick --> checking for `select=true` on all mogwai and changing them to `select=false` before toggling the currently clicked mogwai to `select=true`
1. Enable water feature to add additional mogwai to main array map
1. Enable sunlight feature to delete mogwai or hide mogwai from main array map
1. Remove bottom dev print test strings from user view
1. (Optional) Make responsive?
