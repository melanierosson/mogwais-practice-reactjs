## Introduction
I made this project just to practice learning React JS. It allows you to create, interact with, and customize mogwai.

## Developer TODO's as of 1/24/2021:
* Create main array as wrapper component data to the entire app so it is accessible everywhere
* Componentize main Mogwai.js file data into other JS files
* Styles - Ensure the enabled/disabled buttons are distinct from one another
* Only allow user to select one mogwai at a time
* Enable water feature to add additional mogwai
* Enable sunlight feature to delete mogwai
* Remove bottom dev print tests
